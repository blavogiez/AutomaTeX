### Requirements for the app to work

## Windows-only

## Ollama (Local command-line LLMs)

# After installation, add your "ollama.exe" to PATH environment variables. ()
# To install the models, just type "ollama pull {model}" in a terminal
# (Generations are GPU hungry)
# (Recommended : At least having a graphic card because APU graphics just won't do it.)

## chktex (LaTeX command-line troubleshooter)

# MiKTeX is recommended (auto-installs the TeX packages missing on your computer)

## Argostranslate (AI translation )
# (CPU Hungry)

(If a requirement isn't fulfilled, it won't cause the program to crash. Just know that when you call the buttons | functions that need them, it won't work.)
